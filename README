INSTRUCTIONS

Create resumes by putting sections together.
First create a section (or more).
- Sections can be edited or deleted.

Then, create a new resume.
-Give it a name.
-Choose the sections you would like to add and the order they will go in.
-Resumes can be edited later. (Order of sections can be changed, sections 
     can be added, and sections can be deleted.

When viewing a resume, you can:
-Comment
    -You can delete or edit a comment that you made.
-Rate
    -You can delete a rating that you made.
-If you are the resume creator, you can edit or delete your resume.
    -- When your resume is deleted, all the section/resume reations are 
       also deleted. (Model: resumesection)

My sections shows a list of your sections.

My resumes shows a list of your resumes.

The User Resumes section shows you a list of users.
-When you select a user, a list of their resumes shows up.

Security is set up so that you have to be logged in to access any pages.
Some other pages also require that the creator has the only access 
    - (Ex: edit, delete)

NOTES:

*** For Search, the search functions use "LIKE" which works in on your server, but in 
     Heroku this makes it case-sensitive. The fix is to set it to "ILIKE" for the code 
     that will be on Heroku to make it case -insensitive. (ILIKE does not work in the 
     virtual machine local server.)
